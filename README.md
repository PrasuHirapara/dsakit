# DSA Kit

## Introduction
The **DSA Kit** is a comprehensive toolkit designed for developers and students to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This project provides ready-to-use implementations of various algorithms and data structures, covering all major DSA topics required for problem-solving in competitive programming, interviews, and academic purposes.

## Description
**DSA Kit** offers a collection of efficient algorithms and data structures for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy techniques, graph processing, and more. Each component is implemented in JavaScript and optimized for direct use. This kit is a valuable resource for those aiming to improve their understanding and application of DSA.

### Algorithms (Algo)
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Techniques to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.
- **Greedy**: Algorithms that build a solution piece by piece by choosing the locally optimal solution.
- **Matrix**: Algorithms involving matrix operations and traversal.
- **Sorting**: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- **Searching**: Efficient search algorithms such as Binary Search and Linear Search.
- **String Matching**: Algorithms for pattern matching like KMP, Rabin-Karp, and Z Algorithm.

### Data Structures (DS)
- **Arrays**: Operations and algorithms on arrays.
- **Stack**: Implementations of stack and its advanced operations.
- **Queue**: Queue implementations including circular queue and priority queue.
- **Linked List (LL)**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and their operations.
- **Tree**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, etc.
- **Trie**: Prefix tree for fast searching and auto-completion.
- **Graph**: Graph algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, and Floyd-Warshall.
